SimpleNet: Lets Keep it simple, Using simple architectures to outperform deeper and more complex architectures. 

This repository contains the architectures, Models, logs, etc pertaining to the SimpleNet Paper 
(Lets keep it simple: Using simple architectures to outperform deeper architectures ) : https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06037 

SimpleNet outperforms deeper andheavier architectures such as AlexNet, VGGNet,ResNet,GoogleNet,etc in a series of benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR10/100, MNIST, SVHN. 
It also achievs a higher accuracy (currently 60.88/83.46) in imagenet, more than AlexNet, NIN, Squeezenet, etc with only 5.4M parameters.
